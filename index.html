                Eric XIV was the eldest son of King Gustav Vasa of Sweden and Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg, while he was regarded as intelligent and artistically skilled as well politically ambitious. 
                Early in his reign he showed signs of mental instability, a condition that eventually led to insanity.
                Eric having deposed and imprisoned, was most likely murdered. An examination of his remains in 1958 confirmed that he probaly died of arsenic poisoning.
