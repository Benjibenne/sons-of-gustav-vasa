            <h3> The overthrow off Erik XIV</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-bg"> <br> 
                The struggles and conflicts betweens the brothers was an boiling point that was always growing and even the best effort of Gustav Vasa, 
                their father couldnt steem it or rid it from theirs future with each others. 
                Gustav Vasa last attempt before his passing to hinder infighting betweens the brothers by giving them their own fiefsdom and territory as mention, 
                to them to dispears any desire and wants to overthrow Erik off the throne. 
                The plan work at the begining when the brothers where on equal footing but when the old king of Sweden passed, 
                the expectations and worries became reality the civil infighting and brothely fueds would boil over. 
                When Erik ascended to the throne then he started any means to obstructs any challenge from his brothers mainly Johan III. <br/>
                The Conflicts between the brothers became more intensified 
                and the breaking point came when 1563 Eriks soldiers besieged Åbo castle and imprisioned John and his wife Katarina Jagellonica and their followers as prisoners. 
                4 years of imprisonment in Gripsholms the couple gav birth to two children Isabella who would died in the time and their son Sigismund. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-bg"> And at 1567 the couple got released and the conflict hardend as Johan with his brother Charles started an open rebelion
                 with support from the nobles. 
                After an short but bloody civil war Erik XIV got overthrown by his brothers. 
                Erik would be thrown into jail with his own family as he did to Johan III,
                 in Eriks diaries it read he lived in anxiety and terror after they seperated Erik from his family.
                 The conflict between the brothers Erik and Johan did not end till a day in febuari year 1577 was the day Erik died and later on it was discovered Erik died 
                 by an stedy amount of arsenic poisoning.

            <h3>Rise of Charles IX and conflict between John III</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-bg"> <br> The first years after they overthrown Erik XIV was the relationship between Charles IX and John III relativly good,
                 but it would deterioate as Charles IX political power rouse and John overly sensitivness when Charles keep trying to increase his power. <br>
                The breaking point would be at 1585 when Charles refused attend to Johns wedding day with his second wife Gunilla Bielke. <br>
                There continued to be worries about another uprising and civil war of these brothes in the court as there where no further compromises from either side. <br>
                As their relationship deterioated with their disagreements of changing Swedens church branch they did consolidate to help each other agaisnt Erik Sparre, 
                Hogenskild Bielke and other high nobles. <br>
                But when Johan III passed away 1592 had Charles IX started monopolising political power in Sweden and with stepful climb trough removing polish and chatolic 
                influnce trough Johan III son Sigismund who was both king of Sweden and Poland. <br>
                and at 1595-1597 did Charles succeed in overthrowing Sigismund off the Swedish throne.
