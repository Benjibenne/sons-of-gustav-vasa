## Colour Scheme:
- As the general history websites always follows an bland red and white colour schemes. 
- I had an motivation to find maybe an unique color scheme for my history website or atleast outside of norm of history websites.
- So followed these colours as they werent abrasively to grand or gaunt and felt well suited to my taste and hopefully user friendly.
- Orange-#4d3227, brown-#ebc999, tan-#cd7700.


## Typography:
- I used the Lato and Oswald text styles taken from [view fonts google](https://fonts.google.com/) as I was most familial with these as they where the general families. 
- Used in every challenge prio short projects so didnt feel need to experiment or try out new texts fonts, until I am more experience and have an preference I grown to prefer.

## Imagery:
- the images used in this project are from [view wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), as the images I wanted and feelt needed to use.
- was of specific historical figures like Erik XIV, John III, prince Magnus duke of Ostergotland, and Charles IX.
- and as an historic website feelt more necesary to have the best suited images fitting for users to have an image of the people they are reading about.
