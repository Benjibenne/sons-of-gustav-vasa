##Colour Scheme:
As the general history websites always follows an bland red and white colour schemes. 
I had an motivation to find maybe an unique color scheme for my history website or atleast outside of norm of history websites.
so followed these colours as they werent abrasively to grand or gandy and felt well suited to my taste and hopefully user friendly.
orange-#4d3227, brown-#ebc999, tan-#cd7700.


##Typography:
I used the Lato and Oswald text styles taken from [view fonts google](https://fonts.google.com/) as I was most familial with these as they where the general families. 
Used in every challenge prio short projects so didnt feel need to experiment 
or try out new texts fonts until I am more experience and have an preference I grown to prefer.

##Imagery:
the images used in this project are from [view wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page), as the images I wanted and feelt needed to use.
was of specific historical figures like Erik XIV, John III, prince Magnus duke of Ostergotland, and Charles IX.
and as an historic website feelt more necesary to have the best suited images fitting for users to have an image of the people they are reading about.
